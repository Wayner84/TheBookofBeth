									<p>You don't love him anymore but sometimes when you look at the sky it seems to be the same shade of blue as his eyes. You don't love him anymore but sometimes when you're walking alone with your earphones in, you hear the song you both used to sing together and you get this overwhelming ache deep in your chest. You don't love him anymore but sometimes you catch a glimpse of him laughing and a knot forms in your throat because it used to be your favourite sound. You don't love him anymore but sometimes when you drink so much that you can't even remember your own name, you remember his. You remember the way he held you, the way he kissed you, the way he made you feel special. You don't love him anymore but sometimes when you're at work, or in bed, or watching a movie, or listening to music, it hits you that he's gone and you cry and cry but you swear you don't love him anymore.</p>
