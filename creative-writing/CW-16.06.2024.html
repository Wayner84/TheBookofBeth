                                                                        <p>It’s been two months and I wished you a happy birthday. You said thank you and didn’t talk to me after that.</p>

                                                                        <p>It’s been three months and I heard about your new girl. Of course she was the one I heard rumours of you having g a thing with while you were with me. I shouldn’t have ignored them.</p>

                                                                        <p>It’s been four months and I hate you, yet I’m still hoping you’ll leave her and come back to me.</p>

                                                                        <p>It’s been five months and you started talking to me again, bringing up old memories of been trying to bury.</p>

                                                                        <p>It’s been six months and I am beginning to move on. I like someone else, but I’m not sure what to do yet.</p>

                                                                        <p>It’s been seven months and I heard you’re not with your girl anymore. I feel nothing.</p>

                                                                        <p>It’s been eight months and you’re trying to win me back, but I’ve realised how pointless you are. I don’t care about you anymore.</p>

                                                                        <p>It’s been nine months and I’m doing great, while it has just got you that you’ve lost me.</p>
