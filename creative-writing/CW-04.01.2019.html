									<p>Maybe he still checks her Instagram every so often to see her goofy smile in a sea of pictures, just to remember what it felt like to be the one to make her grin like that. Maybe his heart skips a beat or two when he thinks he sees something that means she's with another someone. Maybe he sighs in relief when he sees that it's just a friend she's with. Maybe he'll drive down the road to get fuel with his Mum and their song will come on, and his Mum will ask why his shoulders tensed up. Maybe he'll quickly change the song and say "I don't know what you're talking about."</p>
									
									<p>Maybe he'll see the shop she always shopped at and slightly smile to himself because he was always complaining that she spent way too much money on things she didn't need. Maybe he'll run his fingers over the skin that covers his heart, because he always knew she loved heartbeats, especially his. Maybe he'll look himself in the mirror and try to admire his eyes the way she did but won't be able to because he never saw why she liked them so much.</p>
									
									<p>But, maybe he doesn't bother to think of her or the things she loved, because maybe he doesn't miss her even a little bit, not even at all.</p>
