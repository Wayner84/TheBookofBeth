										<h1>Perfect timing</h1>
										<p>Published: 2nd December 2020</p>

									<p>I feel like now is the right time for me to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for unmistakably leading you on last year, I'm sorry for the way I treated you with so much disrespect you didn't deserve. I want you to take the time to read this and realise that I really am sorry and this apology is coming from deep down in my heart.</p>
									
									<p>I'll start by saying this - I had feelings for you, not just like year 7 feelings but like ACTUAL feelings, I don't remember the last time I clicked with somebody so well that made me feel like you did. You made me believe that I could be happy again and it sounds so cliche to be saying that. When we were speaking last year I got excited to wake up to your messages, and even though your slow replies got on my nerves I didn't actually mind because I knew they were going to come at some point. I guess I took that for granted a little bit and I admit I messed you around big time. I was in such a messy place back then and I guess I spent too much time giving you shit for it and I know it wasn't your fault at all but you were the closest to me and got the backlash. I do sincerely apologise for that.</p>
									
									<p>I don't really know why I'm messaging you after all this time but I thought it was right. I've been sending you messages every now and again that seem like they're sent to other people but truthfully I've only been sending shit like that to you, hoping and praying that you'll reply with something sarcastic. I didn't get those messages obviously, and I don't know why I expect you to message me because of everything that's happened. I think I just wanted some closure maybe? I don't really know.</p>
									
									<p>This is messy but what I'm trying to say is this - I'm so so so sorry for everything, is there any chance you'll be able to forgive me after all this time and maybe we can start again?</p>
