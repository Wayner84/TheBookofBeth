                                                                        </header>

                                                                        <p>"Little me, it pains me to tell you that on your journey through this life, you will be hurt. More than your heart ever thought possible. You will be betrayed and left in the cold by those you held a close love for, those you would do anything for. You will spend nights questioning your worth with the pillow cradling your head until your neck loses its strength. That fire inside you will slowly and surely die, to the point where it almost takes your life. The isolation will force you to turn inward as the way you once viewed the world crumbles. And it will be like that for a while. You will suffer in silence. You will have those you hold dearest leave you behind to start the next chapter of their lives above the clouds. They will be watching you from above, you can count on that. But all the hardships will not be in vain, I promise. Darling, ride the wave and let it take you out to sea. Conserve your energy, and float on your back while the world’s chaos intensifies until it can no longer do you any more harm. There will be a turning point where something remarkable happens. Your purpose will be found. The reason you were put on this earth. The love you poured into others and thought you lost will find you tenfold. The precious souls meant for yours will return home. You will see them in the iridescence of seashells, a child’s smile on your way to the shops, the first raindrops to grace your cheek after sweltering heat. You will find a love that loves you back, unconditionally. And you will fall in love with not only people, but movies, arts, cuisines. Your eyes will gravitate to the birds in the trees and for once in your life you won’t hold a secret envy towards them being so high above because your aura will be floating alongside them. Little me, one day it will all make sense. It won’t excuse the anguish that you endure, but everything you ever lost will find its way back and fill you with strength. That spark will grow into a flame, and that flame will burn down anything standing in your way.”</p>
