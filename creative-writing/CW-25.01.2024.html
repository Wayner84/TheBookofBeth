I was that girl that needed someone by her side to feel validated. And you were beautiful and charming and most importantly broken too. I didn’t realise you were just as damaged as me when we first met. But that’s why we clicked, isn’t it? I was messed up over a boy and you were the one messing people up. You were just my type. I remember when you told you loved me. Did you even mean it? You because anxious when you said it and you put your head in your knees for a few minutes and god, I felt so much love for you in that moment. Looking back now, I don’t believe you actually did. How can you love someone and not want to call them yours? I was yours in every sense of the word, except I wasn’t really ‘yours’. You refused to call me your girlfriend. We were together every day, you held me all night, you told me all your fears and regrets yet you refused to be mine. What hurts the most is that you didn’t wait to make her yours. Why was I not good enough for you? I tried so hard to be everything you needed. I just wanted you to love me. And it used to bother me to my core, but then I met a boy who thinks I am more than enough. He loves every part of me and couldn’t wait til I was his. But the saddest part is, I still miss you. Sometimes when I lay in bed at night, all I want is to have you next to me. It’s possible to miss someone and not want them back though. I just wish you missed me too.</p>
