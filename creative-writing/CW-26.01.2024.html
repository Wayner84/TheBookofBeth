                                                                        </header>
                                                                        <p>No one will ever fully understand the internal battles you had to endure just to heal, just to grow, just to make it here today. You should be proud of the way you fought to save yourself. you should be proud of the way you survived.</p>

                                                                        <p>In this generation there is so much pressure to be unphased, to be unaffected. The world will try to tell you to just move on, to just distract yourself from what is going on in your heart. It will tell you that you care too much, that you need to move forward as quickly as possible. It happens so often; it can make you question yourself.</p>

                                                                        <p>But you know what is going on in your own soul. You know your heart. No one around you knows how hard you’re trying, how much internal work you’ve done, how brave it is to heal when it hurts. No one knows your silent battles. No one around knows what goes through your mind when the world is quiet, and your thoughts, and your pain, and your memories, and your past knock at your door. No one knows what it’s like to be you, moving through this season. And no one knows what you’ve had to endure, on the deepest level. No one knows what you have truly been through, because they did not personally experience the break, or the loss, or the hurt.</p>

                                                                        <p>This is your reminder that your feelings are valid. This is your reminder to look back at how far you have truly come. Think back to the moments you thought would defeat you. Think back to all of the things you genuinely did not think you would be able to heal from. You have saved yourself so many times before. Day after day. Hour after hour. Minute after minute. And sometimes that has been messy, and sometimes you have fumbled with the weight of healing and what it requires, and sometimes you have taken the long way towards understanding, or closure, or clarity - but you still showed up to do it. That takes a lot of courage, and you are strong enough to do it again, and again, and again. You have been through so much at the hands of this world, but it has never defeated you. There is strength to be found within that.</p>
