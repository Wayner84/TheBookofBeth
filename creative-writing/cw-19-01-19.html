										<h1>Please don't fall in love with me</h1>
										<p>Published: 19th January 2019</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>Sometimes I wish I had a warning sign across my head saying 'Please don't fall in love with me.'</p>
									
									<p>Please don't fall in love with me, I am cruel cold, distant, heartless and emotional. My guards and walls are way up high in the sky, and it will take too much of an effort for you to climb up it, much more to destroy it all the way down.</p>
									
									<p>Please don't fall in love with me, I will cringe every time you touch me, and I'll remember all the horrible ways I was touched before. I'll always have my dressing gown and my bags packed, ready to go and my heart ready to run away from you. And I will not look back.</p>
									
									<p>Please don't fall in love with me, I will always protect myself first before thinking of loving you, and most of the time I don't even know how to love myself for me to know how to love you back.</p>
									
									<p>Please don't fall in love with me, unless you're prepared to share your one beating heart with me. A boy had stolen my heart a long time ago and he never gave it back to me, and I wasn't able to retrieve it again. If you do share your heart with me, expect me to be possessive, jealous and moody for I will not accept any other occupants of your heart.</p>
									
									<p>Fall in love with me only if you're ready to give it your all, only if you're ready to battle with all of my demons, and only if you love me despite all that I am and all that I am not.</p>
									
									<p>And to the boy who has stolen my heart, please fall in love with me.</p>
