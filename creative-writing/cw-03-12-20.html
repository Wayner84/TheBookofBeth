									<p>Is that why you play the music so loud? A beat to drown out the thoughts, sounds so high you cannot think, lyrics so close to home you don't even blink.</p>
									
									<p>If you haven't felt like quitting, your dreams aren't big enough.</p>
									
									<p>It's 12am and her mind wanders. She tends to think about something that happened 5 years ago or something that happened 2 hours ago. Or even something that could happen 10 years from now. Her mind is like a hurricane, it's a wreck. It's beautiful yet awful thoughts. It's now 1am and her mind continues to wander.</p>
									
									<p>Your first love isn't the first person you give your heart to - it's the first person who breaks it.</p>
									
									<p>Truth is, no matter how strong you are, at some point you will hit rock bottom, and it will feel like the world is collapsing beneath your feet; but the only person who can get you back on the surface is yourself.</p>
									
									<p>For you I was just like the last part of a cigarette that you throw on the street and leave to die, you ignited me with your words but killed me with your actions.</p>
									
									<p>After he broke my heart, I began writing about him. I wrote and I wrote and I've described him as a hurricane, a drug, my universe. Now that I've moved on, I don't see him in that way anymore. He wasn't anything above ordinary, he was just a boy. A boy who didn't want to be with me and that's that.</p>
