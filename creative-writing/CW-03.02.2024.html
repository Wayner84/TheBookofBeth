It’s from people who don’t believe in gentle kisses and warm hugs, it’s from people who loved with hatred in their hearts, from people who thought the only way to have me, and to claim me as their own, was if they left something tangible of their existence on me, so they painted my skin every time, with bruises, scratches, and cuts, and marked me with their burnt out cigarettes.”</p>

                                                                        <p>I smiled to him “you can count my scars love, but gently please, it still hurts, it never stops hurting.”</p>
