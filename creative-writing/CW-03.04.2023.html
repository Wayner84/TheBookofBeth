									<p>With every single "hello" and every single time you drunk called me at 2am in the morning, you gave me a reason to hope. You gave me a reason to hold on to the feelings I had for you, the feelings I really wanted to erase" she said, her eyes so blue the ocean would be jealous.</p>
									
									<p>"I thought about you, every second of every day, thought about what I could give you, the way I'd love you, if you only let me. I thought about the way I wanted to touch you so bad. In every moment, you were the only thing I thought could make me happy." She started whispering, trying not to cry, trying to hold in the pain she felt so deeply.</p>
									
									<p>"But after hurting this bad, I had to let go. Yes, it was one of the most painful things I've ever done. But I know that you will never love me the way I love you, I know that you will only tear me apart, day by day. I have to let you go"</p>
									
									<p>She looked at me, one last time and then she was gone.</p>
