                                                                        </header>

I’m not talking about things ending and still wishing for it to be like before. This is the type that you’ve finally accepted it, and you’re now hoping for a new beginning. The type of feeling that blooms in your chest and you’re a little bit excited and giddy, and wishful and hopeful, of what’s yet to come. The feeling of acceptance mixed with anticipation for the future. Will you meet him at the supermarket whilst doing your weekly shop? Or at the coffee shop early in the morning? Will you meet him on a rainy night when you forget your umbrella and he’s just standing there looking like an angel in disguise? Or maybe, you’ll meet him in the most mundane way, when a friend of yours will just casually introduce him to you, without any motive of linking you two together, but somehow your eyes meet and your laughters sync, and you both just click.</p>

                                                                        <p>It’s almost like the feeling you get when the Christmas season is about to start, the feeling of festivity, of anticipation, of hope. It’s like this time, anything can happen, and finally, finally, you’re ready to grasp and trust the magic that comes with new beginnings.</p>

                                                                        <p>Relish this feeling when you get it. Hold on to it. It’s your hearts way of whispering “hey, I’m getting there, I’m healing, I’m getting okay, we are about there, just hold on, we could do this.”</p>
