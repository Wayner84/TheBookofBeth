Fighting, arguing, screaming, crying, trying, so much trying. Repeating myself, oh my god, all I fucking did was repeat myself over, and over again - and why? For what? At work, stressed and crying in the bathroom. At home, tossing and turning in bed, tormenting myself with ‘why is he treating me this way?’ questions. Fucking stupidness - and I’m over it. I have a good heart, and I’m not giving it to any more men who prove that they don’t deserve it. This vicious cycle started with me allowing it all to keep happening, and I’m ending it with me NOT allowing it to happen again. I absolutely didn’t know my worth back then, but now that I do, there will be no settling, or feeling guilty about standing firmly in my wants, and needs. I’m not asking for a man to move fucking mountains for me - I’m asking for the very same things they want from me. You want respect, loyalty, peace of mind, love and happiness? Well so the fuck do I! So if you cannot give me the same shot you’re asking for, then you’ve got to GO. No more complications. You either will, or you won’t - and if you won’t, it’s all good. There’s someone out there who will, and happily.</p>
