She changes the conversation to trivial things and trips over her words when she’s uncomfortable. Be patient and she will open up. She moves her mouth, scrunched up, to the right when she’s trying to plan something. Go with the flow of it. She forgets to drink water sometimes. Remind her because she gets headaches. She closes off and goes cold when she’s trying to protect herself. Show her that she doesn’t need to do that alone. She will come back and warm your soul. She shakes her leg and bites her nails when she’s nervous. Lay your hand on hers and calm her with your eyes. She will retreat and seem distant when she’s feeling lost. Sit in the dark with her until she’s ready for the light of you, guiding her home. She will go for days pondering something you’ve said that bothered her. Don’t make her talk about it until she thinks it’s time, but look for subtle hints. Give her plenty of space to ramble before she gets to the point. She puts her hair in her face in an attempt to hide it when she’s nervous wants to disappear. Brush it back behind her ear and let her know you see her and you love who you see in front of you. She doesn’t like negative emotions or confrontation in the least and will do everything she can to avoid both of those. Let her know that she is safe with you. She will love you so completely, you will forget what it feels like to be broken. Love her with all you have and then some. She’s worth it.</p>
