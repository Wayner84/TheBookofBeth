                                                                        </header>
                                                                        <p>The problem is, I don’t know what I want from you. I have so many things I wish to say but to what end I do not know. There are endless routes I could take to contact you, but what would be the purpose? One I want to send you a hateful letter, scribbled in anger and burning red, intent on hurting you and a moment later I want to send you a love note, glowing white and exuberant, reminding you of the ways in which I ache. On rainy days when my emotions claw behind my eyes, I want to call you and scream in a frantic rage and when the sun sits high above me in the pale blue sky I want to calmly thank you for existing. It seems that I cannot decide on how to get in touch with you because each course would lead to a different result and I haven’t a clue which I want most. One approach might invite a response (good or bad, I do not know) while another could send you further off into the unknown space you currently inhabit. I am uncertain if I wish to hurt you or if I just want to wish you well, so by all appearances, this confusion is why I sit back, distressed, doing nothing instead.</p>

                                                                        <p>However, if you were to draw a map of all the emotions I have for you and all the ways I could try to reach you and all the different words I might say, you would see that everything leads back to one desire. I don’t want anything from you that is within the realm of possibility. What I truly want is for none of it to have ever happened. I want you here, beside me, but before this, before her. I cannot have you as you are now; I want you as it was back then. I want you two years ago. I want your hand on my hips and your fingers intertwined with mine the way things were. I want you wrapped around me, limbs entangled, hearts pulsing in a long lost winter. I want you snug in my bed beneath silky sheet and quiet sighs during an autumn well in my past. I don’t know what I want from you and I don’t know know what to say because no matter what words I use and no matter what result they produce, I can never again have you as the way you were before. Even if you came to me tomorrow and begged for my forgiveness, it would not change the places you have been, the things that you have done, and the person you have loved since then. And because of this. I cannot find revolution. So I sit here and dwell on my emotions in silence, I do not dare to reach out to you as no arrangement of words and no collection of sentences could ever bring us back in time.</p>
