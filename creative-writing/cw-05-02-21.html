										<h1>To the boy who...</h1>
										<p>Published: 5th February 2021</p>

									<p>To the boy who knew me better than I knew myself<br />
									To the boy who was there every time I needed help<br />
									To the boy who took all of my trust with him</p>
									
									<p>To the boy who left<br />
									I was so angry at you<br />
									I was so hurt by you<br />
									I am still so angry at you<br />
									And I'm sick of feeling this way with you<br />
									Because truth is, I was so in love with you</p>
									
									<p>And I would never have told you.<br />
									I would have kept ignoring the butterflies whenever I'm with you<br />
									I would have kept pinching myself whenever you walked into the room<br />
									I would have kept turning you into poetry so I can keep flipping through my notebook<br />
									And there I would find a thousand different ways to describe your eyes<br />
									A thousand different ways to describe your smile<br />
									A thousand different ways to describe how I feel every time you walk by<br />
									And that's why it hurts.</p>
									
									<p>It hurts in a quiet way<br />
									In a way that I felt like you were tugging at my chest<br />
									In a way that it felt like you were drowning me.<br />
									The memory of you burning into me</p>
