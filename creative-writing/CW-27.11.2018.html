									<p>There was a point in my life when I absolutely hated everything about myself. Hair, voice, face, stomach, thighs. I remember one time, I was crying myself to sleep. It was three in the morning and I was crying quietly because I didn't want to wake up my Mum. I thought, "hating myself is going to get me where?" Ever since that night I wanted the pain to end, I gradually got better. It didn't happen in a snap or a flicker in the light, it happened over a long time.</p>
									
									<p>The thing is, when I tell people this story, they ask me who made me realise it is worth living. Who inspired me to get better? Did I do it for my Mum? I never told anyone how I was feeling back when all of this was happening. No one knew. Nobody and nothing inspired me to get better. When I look back, telling someone would have been the best thing to do. I needed help, but I was extremely lucky I got out by myself.</p>
