									<p>After a while, the hurt hurts less. You start to see reason, understand why they did what they did. Knowing that it takes two hands to clap. Learn, that not everyone you meet will stay in your life forever. Sometimes, they're a passing character in a chapter of your book. There to teach you a lesson, to help you experience different things in life - different emotions, to grow, and maybe to show you how to love yourself better. Find your worth.</p>
									
									<p>At the beginning, it will hurt. It's the kind of hurt that will leave you crying till you fall asleep at 3am, puffy eyes, nose blocked and swollen. The kind of hurt that follows you everywhere - reminding you of the memories you shared at particular places you pass by. The hurt that leaves you thinking if you ever meant anything to them. Heartbreak is inevitable, especially with the people you love. But if it's one thing I've learned: you cannot have expectations. You can't expect them to love you back the same way you love them, with the same amount of intensity, and that, is the sad truth. The way you love someone does not determine the way that person is going to love you back. You can have multiple connections with people, but that does not necessarily mean that they are meant for you, and, it's the same with love.</p>
									
									<p>The hardest part about losing someone you love, is not the goodbye, but learning to live without them. And what fuels the hurt is when you see how they're able to move on without you. But can you blame them? Honestly, you can't. My Grandmother always said "If you really love that person, you will want them to be happy. Even if that means that they're going to be happy without you, you will respect that and let them go. Because you want them to be happy." But what if I don't want to let them go? Would you rather be with someone, but that person does not feel the same kind of happiness with you? That bothered me. The one thing people crave, it' love and being valued. However, when you look for love, to fill that void they've left behind, it never really works out. It's not entirely genuine. It's more of a forced connection because you want to fill that void. You crave that drug and rush so called 'love' because it's a beautiful feeling. However, the best kind of love, is unexpected love because you're not looking for something, you're not looking for healing. Sometimes, through the people we meet, we find healing. They help you get back onto your feet, but you're much stronger now. Stronger than before, aware. Aware of how love can be so pure and fragile, yet it has the power to break, shatter and destroy. Wiser, as to who you allow yourself to love.</p>
