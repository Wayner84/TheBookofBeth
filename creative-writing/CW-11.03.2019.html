									<p>I just wanted to talk to him one last time. To hear his voice and hear the way he said 'hello' as he picked up the phone. I wanted to hear him say he loved me and that these last few months have been hard for him to even try to forget me. I wanted him to say he missed me, and that he wanted to come back, because God, that's what I wished for. I was fucking ridiculous for feeling this way, yet I just couldn't seem to let him go. I wanted to talk to him one last time. Just once more. Maybe then I could finally let go.</p>
