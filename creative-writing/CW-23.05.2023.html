										<h1>Is he right for you?</h1>
										<p>Published: 23rd May 2023</p>

									<p>Does his laughter warm your body from the inside out? He knows that when you say two scoops you really mean three, right? Do you dance in his living room while drinking cheap wine? I hope so, and I hope you're both drunk and terrible and laughing so hard you cry. Does he tell you how beautiful you are, and if yes, does he say it when the morning light falls upon your face? More importantly, when he tells you, do you believe him? Do you cry in front of him? I hope you can, that means you trust him. When it's pouring rain does he know that if your hair is straight or your eyes are sad that means he should get the car and bring it to you? When he asks what you want for dinner and you say you aren't hungry, does he ask if you've eaten today? And when you say you had breakfast, I hope he knows you don't eat breakfast, and makes you a bowl of rice, because that's your favourite comfort food. Does he kiss you good morning? Goodnight? Just because? Do you know he likes his coffee black? Unless he wants it cooled, then he will probably want some milk in it, but not too much. Have you figured out where he's ticklish? Don't let him convince you he's not, I promise you he is. Have you frustrated the hell out of him yet? You will, oh, you will, but it's how the two of you come out of it that matters. And when he said he loved you for the first time, did you respond by asking him if he's afraid of heights? I hope with my entire soul he said yes because that means despite his fear, he fell for you. Now, darling, you tell me, is he the one?</p>
