									<p>It's not that I don't love you. It's the sound I heard when I was 9 and my step-father slammed the front door so hard behind him, I swear to god it shook the whole house. For the next 3 years, I watched my mother break her teeth on wine bottles. I think she stopped breathing when he left. I think part of her died. I think he took her heart with him when he walked out. Her chest is empty, just a shattered mess or cracked ribs and depression pills.</p>
									
									<p>It's not that I don't love you. It's all the blood in the sink. It's the night I spent in the emergency room, after the boy I once loved told me he didn't love me anymore. It's the crying, and the fluorescent lights, and white trainers and pale faces and shaky breaths and blood. So much blood.</p>
									
									<p>It's not that I don't love you. It's the time I had to stay up for two days straight with my best friend while she cried and shrieked and threw up on my bedroom floor because her boyfriend fucked his ex. I swear to god she still has tear streaks stained onto her cheeks. I think when you love someone it never really goes away.</p>
									
									<p>It's not that I don't love you. It's the six weeks we had a substitute in English because our teacher was getting divorced and couldn't handle getting out of bed. When she came back she was smiling. But her hands shook so much when she held her coffee, you could see that something was broken inside. And sometimes when things break, you can't fix them. Nothing ever goes back to how it was.</p>
