									<p>One day he's going to know. He'll know your birthday, your middle name, where you were born, your star sign and your parents names. He'll know how old you were when you learned to ride a bike, how many pets you had and how much you hated going to school. He'll know your eye colour, your scars, your freckles, your laugh lines and your birth marks. He'll know your favourite book, favourite movie, food, pair of shoes, colour and song. He's going to know why you're awake at 5am most nights, where you were when you realised you'd lost a good friend, why you picked up the razor and how you managed to put it down before things went too far. He's going to know your phobias, your dreams, your fears, your wishes and your worries. He's going to know about your first heartbreak, your dream wedding and your problems with your parents. He'll know your strengths, your weaknesses, laziness, energy and your mixed emotions. He's going to know about your love for marmite, your dream of being famous when you were five, your need to quote any film you know all the way through, and your fear of growing older. He'll know your bad habits, your mannerisms, your stroppy pout, your facial expressions and your laugh like it's his favourite song. The way you chew, drink, walk, sleep, fidget and kiss. He's going to know that you've already picked out wedding flowers, baby names, tiles for the bathroom, bridesmaid dresses and colours for the bedroom walls. He's going to know, get annoyed at and then accept that you leave clothes everywhere and take twenty minutes to order a Starbucks. He'll know your McDonald's order, how many sugars to put in your tea, how many scoops of ice cream you want, and that you need your sandwiches cut into triangles because they taste better that way. He's going to know how you feel without you telling him, that you need a wee from the look on your face, and that you're crying without shedding tears. He's going to know all of it. Everything. You, from top to bottom and inside out. From learning, from sharing, from listening, from watching. He's going to know every single thing there is to know, and you know what else? He is still going to love you.</p>
