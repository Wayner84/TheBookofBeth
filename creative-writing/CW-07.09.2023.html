You’re the one I want to roll to in the middle of the night and wake up next to everyday, for the rest of my life. You’re the one I want to go on late night runs with for food just because we wanted to get out of the house. You’re the one I want I want to take on cute little dates like to a movie, or to a nice, fancy dinner, or to an early morning breakfast before we both have to go out separate ways for the day. You’re the one I want to take on cute all day days like to the aquarium or the beach. You’re the one I want to go on fun, exhilarating adventures with, such as a day at the lake, or a hike through the woods, or even just a late night walk when everything is quiet. You’re the one I want to stay in with for the night and build a cute little fort while we watch movies movies under it and eat our favourite snacks. You’re the one I want to make happy for the rest of my life. You’re the one I want to love, and to hold when times get tough. You’re the one I want to be there for when everything in your world comes crashing down. All my good days and bad days, you’re the one I want to spend them with. It’s you. You’re it. You’re the one. And I swear to you, I have never been so sure about someone or something in my entire life. It’s you, and I say this without a single doubt in my mind.</p>
