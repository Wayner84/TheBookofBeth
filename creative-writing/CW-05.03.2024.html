She tends to overreact, and she gets a little insecure once in a while. She’ll be needy for your attention. She wants to literally take up all of your time and she’ll require a lot of reassurance. She isn’t capable of fully trusting you. She doesn’t know when to stop fighting with you, even if she’s wrong. She has no problem pushing you away if she feels like you’re close to hurting her. Loving her will stress you out, loving her will make you angry, loving her will break your heart at times, loving her will test you, loving her will challenge you, and loving her will change you. It may get so demanding that you’ll be tempted to walk away. It may get so hard that you think about giving up. And it may get so complicated that you won’t want to deal with her anymore. Loving her means you get to see her at her worst and most vulnerable and that’s something you have to be strong enough to handle because she needs someone who’s patient enough to understand why she is who she is today. It’s not going to be an easy relationship with her but if she is in love with you then she can promise that you’ll be loved with such passion and intensity that you will forget what life felt like before she came along because she’ll always be there to put your heart back together after breaking it. Maybe she’s not the best at being loved but she’s pretty amazing at loving.</p>
