She even told everyone that she was going to sleep, just so you could have all her attention. You lost a girl who would do anything to be in your arms. You lost a girl who would hold your hand whenever she had the chance. You lost a girl who would say “I love you” and mean it with all her heart. You lost a girl who saw you as her world. You lost a girl who put so much time and effort into you. You lost a girl who would always put you first over everything and anyone, including herself. You lost a girl who would always stay by your side, even after the many times you fucked up. A girl like that is quite hard to find, and you had the privilege to meet one. She also fell completely in love with you, that’s even more of a privilege. But you blew it. You decided to fuck it all up. And now she’ll go and find someone that’ll appreciate every bit of her and is willing to put in as much effort as she does, because that is what she deserves. And you didn’t deserve her at all.</p>
