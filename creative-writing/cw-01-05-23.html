										<h1>This is my story</h1>
										<p>Published: 1st May 2023</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>When I was 18, I was raped. It wasn't the kind you hear about on the news, a random person walking down the street that was targeted. Oh no, this was by somebody I'd been talking to for a while, someone I thought I could trust. It was someone I wanted to get to know on a romantic level. I "fancied" him so much, I genuinely thought that we were going to become a thing. I couldn't have been more wrong.</p>
									
									<p>It was November 10th, 2018, the day before remembrance Sunday. I remember it so clear, as if it happened yesterday. I'd taken a train to Malvern as neither of us could drive and I said I'd go to his as I didn't want him to come to mine. Maybe that was my first mistake?</p>
									
									<p>When I got off the train, we went to the shop to get snacks for our "movie night" we had planned over messages the night before. It was the first time meeting him in person, we'd spoken loads over video and phone calls so it wasn't too awkward. It felt kind of right, it felt like I'd know him for ages.</p>
									
									<p>When we got to his house, he introduced me to his parents and they were two of the kindest people I'd met and made me feel so welcome. We then went to his bedroom, his parents were cooking dinner and said there would be enough for us so we said we'd just put some YouTube or something on before it was ready. He had set the tv up and we just put a random video on and just cuddled a little bit and then we started to kiss. I was fine with it, was kind of into it at first but then he started touching me in places I didn't yet feel comfortable so I asked him to please stop. He didn't. He carried on as if I had given him permission, as if us kissing was me saying "yes". The next thing I know, I'm naked and bent over and he's forcing himself into me, I kept saying "stop" and "no, I don't want it" but he wouldn't listen, there was nothing I could do. I was frozen still at this point and in the position we were in I couldn't push him away, I tried so hard. He flipped me over and held my wrists so tight I started to get pins and needles, I was sobbing and couldn't even look at him. He took complete advantage of me, just because we shared a kiss.</p>
									
									<p>After he'd finished and did what he needed to do, he just got dressed and said he was going to see how long dinner would be. I was still frozen and couldn't move, I didn't think I could cry anymore but the tears kept coming. He came back about 2 minutes later and I still hadn't gotten dressed, I just wrapped myself in his duvet. He told me that dinner was ready and his parents didn't like him eating in his bedroom so I had to go into the lounge, I had no choice but to get myself up and get dressed. I walked into his lounge as if nothing had happened, because what else could I do? I hadn't fully processed at that point what had really happened but was thankful to be in a different room. We had dinner and then told his parents we were going to watch a movie and goodnight.</p>
									
									<p>The bathroom was on the way to his bedroom so I told him I'd meet him in there as I needed to go, I was feeling quite sore down below. When I'd gone to the toilet, I noticed there was a lot of blood in my underwear, and then when I had finished the toilet bowl was bright red with blood. I didn't know what to do apart from clean myself up and hope I wouldn't bleed anymore. All I wanted to do was go home but I couldn't because there weren't any more trains that night and I already had one booked for the next morning.</p>
									
									<p>I went back to his bedroom and we led on his bed in silence whilst the film was on, about halfway through he went onto his phone and asked me to "help find a girlfriend". I was so angry and told him no I'm going to sleep, we turned off the lights and I led all night shaking and too scared to fall asleep in case he did it again. I was too scared to move in case he tried something else, so I stayed as still as I could and just waited for the morning so I could be in the safety of my own bed.</p>
									
									<p>The next morning I had to catch the train at about 11:30am, I remember it was around this time because it was Remembrance Sunday and I left whilst he was doing the 2 minutes silence at 11am. He didn't bother saying goodbye to me and got his Dad to drive me to the station as he "couldn't be bothered".</p>
									
									<p>Once I was at the train station, I sobbed and sobbed in the bathroom until my train was there. I didn't hear from him for weeks afterwards but he messaged me on a random Wednesday in the January of 2019 asking me how I was doing. I blocked him after telling him how what he did effected me.</p>
									
									<p>And that's my story, that's the reason I find it hard to trust people, that's the reason I don't like to meet new people anymore, that's the reason I am who I am today. I do believe it has made me a stronger person but it has also terrified me, it's not something I would ever wish on anybody, not even my worst enemy.</p>
