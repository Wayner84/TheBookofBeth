										<h1>How do I tell you how I feel?</h1>
										<p>Published: 7th April 2023</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>I saw you over there, on the other side of the coffee shop. I'd been watching for a while now, even though I've only lived here a little over a month, I saw you straight away.</p>
									
									<p>The first thing I noticed of you were your bright blue eyes, they shone from across the room, they were so bright and sparkled so much in the morning sunlight. I don't know anybody here but I feel like I know you, I want to know you.</p>
									
									<p>I do know your coffee order - a caramel macchiato with an extra shot of coffee - sweet but packs a punch, is that what you're like? Maybe, maybe not.</p>
									
									<p>I should pluck up the courage and just speak to you, but how am I supposed to tell you, a stranger, this is how I feel?</p>
									
									<p>How am I supposed to tell you I get shy when it comes to you, I'm never shy. How am I supposed to tell you that whenever I'm around you I get so tense, and whenever I hear you speak, my heart stops. Don't even get me started on your smile, your smile is the most beautiful thing I've seen by far, when you smile it feels like I'm complete and I can't do anything but stare.</p>
									
									<p>I'm just a regular guy who has moved to a new city and fallen hopelessly in love with a girl in a coffee shop.</p>
