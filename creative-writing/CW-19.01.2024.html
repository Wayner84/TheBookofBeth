                                                                        </header>

I can’t picture you actually missing me, I can’t imagine you actually wishing I hadn’t said I was done with grey and in between. I feel like I’m so insignificant to you, like you have no feelings, like you couldn’t care less, this is just life, people come and go. And I know that, I know this is just life, and that people come and go, but it hurts that it’d never cross your mind to ask me to stay, that I was fun whilst I lasted, that you never wanted to make me yours. I want to matter more to you. You’re a thinker and I’m a feeler. You hate that I’m so black and white, but I’m selfish and I want 3am texts that you can’t stop thinking about me and that you need to see me again soon. But that’s not who you are and it’s unfair of me to want you to feel that way when you don’t. And it’s really okay, because if I extended my hand to you and you took it, I don’t think we would’ve gotten very far anyway. I loved being so close to you, but I’m excited to hold someone’s hand who doesn’t want to let go, to kiss someone who wants to kiss me forever, to not be anticipating an inevitable end, to be able to trust someone fully with my heart, to have someone that wants to hold it. And I don’t need that, I don’t need someone, I don’t need anyone. But if one day it’s what’s meant to be, I’ll let it be. I don’t want to be careless with my heart again. I don’t know why things happen the way they do, and I don’t regret you for a second, and I still think the world of you, but I’m too emotional and I fall too deep to give that much of myself again to someone who never asked for any of it in the first place.</p>
