										<h1>I need to move on</h1>
										<p>Published: 4th June 2023</p>

									<p>This is me moving on. This is me accepting the ache of missing you. This is me waking up every single day, aware of what is missing, but accepting the fact that this is my life now, that this is the way things are going to be. This is me understanding that it is okay to have my heartbeat speak your name. This is me understanding that it is okay to miss someone who was such a staple in my life. But this is also me understanding that life does go on. That one day I will hear the songs and smile, I will sleep in my sheets and they will no longer smell of you; one day I will fall in love again, one day I will look back on this and my hands will no shake with the heaviness of it all.</p>
									
									<p>This is me moving on. This is me accepting the fact we will no longer make memories together. This is me coming to terms with the reality of a future without you. This is me understanding that you will do everything we have spoken about - you will live a life you are proud of, you will become the person you told me you hoped you could be, you will take the trips, you will experience all of the things you wanted to experience, you will love - deeply and wholly, and with every inch of your heart, but all of that will happen without me by your side.</p>
									
									<p>This is me moving on. This is me accepting that sometimes beautiful things come to an end. This is me understating that there is nothing I can say, or do, to fix that. This is me coming to terms with the fact that sometimes leaving is an act of love, too. That sometimes you have to walk away from something soft and hauntingly real, that sometimes hearts don't align. But this is me accepting that endings don't have to be messy. This is me understanding how incredible it really is - that for a moment in time, in a world of billions, two strangers were in the right place, at the right time, and something transpired between them. This is my heart swelling with the thought - that at one point in time, we were the lucky ones. At one point in time, we beat the odds.</p>
