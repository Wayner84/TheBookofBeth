									<p>"Tell me how it made you feel</p>
									
									<p>"Honestly?" I paused, reminding myself how I felt the day it happened. "I felt unwanted, isolated and broken. It made me feel worthless, like he was the only one that ever cared about me. It's silly really, I spent so much time believing the things he was telling me and believing he was everything to me, when in reality it was all a lie." .</p>
									
									<p>I paused to catch my breath, holding back tears. I don't know why he's affected me so much, he doesn't care about me so why should I care about him? "I thought I was absolutely everything to him, maybe in the beginning I was, like he told me, but now? I don't believe anything. He ripped my heart into a thousand tiny pieces and feels no remorse. He feels nothing, knowing that I am broken and crying myself to sleep at night. He doesn't love me anymore but the saddest part is, I still love him."</p>
