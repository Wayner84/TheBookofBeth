I hope that what everyone told you, about how I kept breaking down to the sound of your name and about how I couldn’t go ten minutes in a conversation without bringing you up, finally registers just how much I cared for you and how much I wanted it to work. I hope you sit there for hours thinking about calling me and apologising, wondering if I’d be asleep, out with friends or family. God I hope that it gets to the point where you start crying and get so mad at yourself for what you did to me. I hope you see me out and about not looking at you because I realised at some point you were never going to be looking back. I hope you break down. I hope your friends are assholes and make fun of you. I hope my brother asks you what’s wrong and you tell him you fucked up. I hope he says you have to stay the fuck away from me because a year ago it was me in that position. I hope you try and talk to me and I speak to you as if you are the world again. I hope it tears you up inside how you can see my eyes still light up like that. I hope I have the strength to not go back to you, but I hope you come back to me.</p>
