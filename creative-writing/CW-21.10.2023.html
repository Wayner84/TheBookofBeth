I hope you dance with them in the small space in your kitchen, messy hair and tired eyes because you’ve both been up all night watching movies again. I hope you laugh with them in a way you never did with anyone else, head tilted back and lips apart as you let out every sound your laugh can possibly make and I hope to god you don’t try and cover your mouth. And if you do, because that’s okay, I know I sometimes do, I hope they stop you. I hope they grab your hand before it ever comes into contact with your lips and I hope they hold it to their chest as they watch you with kind loving eyes. Because fuck, everyone knows you deserve it. And I hope you’ll find someone who’ll accept you. I hope they accept your messy hair in the mornings and I hope they accept the way you sometimes talk too much and can’t seem to stop when you’re nervous or how you still cry yourself to sleep on some nights. I hope they hold you and kiss you on the places you’re most insecure and I hope you god you let them. I hope you find somebody who makes you happy, even when you feel like sometimes life is too hard for you. And I hope that when you both come across a tough situation and it comes down to a choice where you are one of them, I hope they choose you. Every god damn time, I hope they choose you.</p>
