Everything about you was so fatal, yet I was so reckless. I watched you grab me by my waist and tear me in two. Then I witnessed you take me limb by limb, my hands when you first held them so tight as if the world was spinning at the speed of light and they were the only still thing you could find, my legs when they were wrapped around your waist as if they were a vine clinging onto a wall. But, now as I sit here with the weight of a thousand planets on my chest, I realise, that I always knew you’d be the reason of the bags under my eyes, unmade bedsheets and the tangled knots in my hair. I knew it and I walked into it headfirst, so ferociously. But you know what the worst part is? I love every single second of it. And if you’d just offer me your hand one more time, I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat without knowing if that’s the testimony of my love for you, or the testimony of my sheer stupidity.</p>
