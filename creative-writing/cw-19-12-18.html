										<h1>shes moved on, you haven't</h1>
										<p>Published: 19th December 2018</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>One day, someone will tell you that she's seeing someone, that she's happier than ever and your hands will stop working. You'll have to work hard to hold onto whatever you're holding, I hope it's not glass, I hope it isn't breakable. You'll suddenly remember everything you ever loved about her. Everything that moved you to tears, even though you always told her you don't cry. You'll remember that she was so loyal, that she was open for you, that she smiled against your mouth whenever you kissed. That it felt easy, like God was completely real and had put you two together for a reason.</p>
									
									<p>But for whatever other reason, you let her go and you thought that it was the right thing and for a little while, it felt like you knew exactly what you were doing. Except now all the parts of you that touched her knows that you're never going to be able to do it again and that really hurts. Even your fingers are sad, and your stomach is hurting from the loss of it all. You're never going to hear her say your name again and that's why your regret looks like artwork that would have been a masterpiece if you'd have finished it. Your regret looks like plucking a flower before it's bloomed.</p>
									
									<p>Maybe you'll call her and you'll tell her that you miss her and she'll sound so gentle on the phone but not in love with you anymore. She'll say "we happened and we were important but you let me go" and that's how you'll know you left it too long.</p>
