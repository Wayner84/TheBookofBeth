                                                                        <p>Not everyone who comes into your life is meant to stay forever. You have to understand that there will be people placed in your life for not only growth, but self realisation purposes. You will be tested. more than often, you’ll fail. Work on passing. People will make you love them deeper than you’ve ever loved before, and then leave. You have to love yourself enough to not sink. People will pick at your every flaw, making you self conscious. You have to promise yourself, you’ll never come to a point where you hate yourself. People will love you right, I promise. They’ll come in and they’ll actually stay. But sometimes, you still won’t be happy. You have to take risks and distance yourself from your fears. Never allow yourself to get too comfortable to where you feel like you’re “stuck”. You aren’t stuck babe, you’re stagnant. Nothing beautiful comes from this place. There will be people who choose you in convenience. Whether it be because you live close by, or because you’re the only person they know who will always be there. It’s okay to not be there. Situate your own self. Don’t allow anyone to use you when it’s convenient for them. And for your own good, don’t use anyone in convenience either. There will be people who come into your life and want you for themselves. They’ll become possessive of you. Often, more times than not, they’ll be possessive of other people too. You probably aren’t the only one. And it’s easy to get caught in these situations when they make you feel loved and make you feel like you matter, but you are not an option. You never will be. You have to make sure that you never give anyone the power to make you feel less than. When a person has options, or more than one love, you always end up wondering. Wondering whether you’re good enough, wondering why you aren’t the only one, wondering if you’re the first option. Fuck that. You deserve to be with someone who will only choose you, day in and day out. You deserve to be with the person who makes you happiest inside and glow on the outside. You deserve to be with someone who will protect and take care of your heart, who will encourage you to keep growing. You deserve to continuously learn more and more about yourself and work at loving all of you better. You deserve to be with someone who wants you to love yourself more than you love them, so that if they ever leave, you don’t leave with them.</p>
