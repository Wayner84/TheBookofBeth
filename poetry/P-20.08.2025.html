                                                                        </header>
                                                                        <p>I’ve always been a girl that believes in everything or nothing,<br />
Maybe it’s because I grew up in a home where love was never in between,<br />
I love my mother and my step father<br />
And they loved each other,<br />
Until one day they didn’t,<br />
And my sister and I would sit halfway down the steps,<br />
And listen to them learning to unlove each other,<br />
I learned to fall asleep to the sound of raised voices and breaking dishes,<br />
They’re getting a divorce when I’m 7, 12, 17,<br />
But the only consistency is screaming,<br />
And silence only broken by slamming doors,<br />
Bits of my parents love dances between the tension of my childhood home,<br />
And my first place alone,<br />
Like dust that settles on picture frames that hold their wedding photo,<br />
They say a quiet love is safe,<br />
But I seek out a love that shouts,<br />
I hate the in betweens of hellos and goodbyes,<br />
Moving from one place to another,<br />
The space between I love you and I can’t do this anymore,<br />
I want what lasts forever though I’m not foolish enough to think that anything does,<br />
But I am certain that my mother once meant it when she said I do,<br />
So don’t try to love me unless you believe you really could,<br />
If you can’t promise to stay,<br />
When the house shakes so hard that’s our wedding photo falls off the wall,<br />
Please don’t ask me to open my door,<br />
I don’t want pieces of your love,<br />
And my half-built half-broken home,<br />
And I don’t want my daughters sitting on the steps,<br />
Listening to us yell,<br />
Wondering if love is supposed to sound like this,<br />
They say the best loves are patient,<br />
That they’re quiet,<br />
But love doesn’t have to be silent,<br />
And silence doesn’t have to mean absence,<br />
It could be my step fathers gentle hand on the small of my mothers back,<br />
Or the soft crackle of the fire he built for her to read by,<br />
Warmly,<br />
Calmly,<br />
And loving someone loudly doesn’t have to mean screaming,<br />
It could be my parents laughter spilling into the night,<br />
Reaching the ears of a little girl,<br />
Who doesn’t yet know that her heart is listening,<br />
Through walls she is unaware that she is building,<br />
It’s in the in-between that she discovers the secret to what holds a home together,<br />
So I’ll build my home with you,<br />
In the hush after the hurt,<br />
In the fireplace that always stays warm,<br />
And I will teach our daughters that everything or nothing,<br />
Is not the only way to love.</p>
